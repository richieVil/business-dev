# User Sprint Prompts

# Sprint 0: The Gauntlet Protocol
**Objective:** To filter raw business ideas through a high-friction feasibility audit before performing any Business Model Canvas (BMC) engineering.

## 1. Trigger Conditions
- Trigger Sprint 0 if `Status` is `RAW` or `BLANK`.
- Trigger Sprint 0 if the `Total Score` is below 15.
- Trigger Sprint 1 skip only if the idea is `LAB-READY` (Score >18 + Direct Substitution).

## 2. The Execution Flow
### Phase A: The Kill-Switch Audit (Red-Team)
The Architect must identify the "Single Point of Failure" for the idea. 
- **Data Access:** Is the required data hidden behind a wall?
- **Behavioral Friction:** Does this require a CEO to change a 20-year habit?
- **Incumbent Defense:** Would a giant (JLL, Salesforce, etc.) crush this in 30 days?

### Phase B: Pivot Divergence
If the idea is "Killed" or has low scores, the Architect MUST generate a **Pivot Menu** of 5-10 variations. Each variation must optimize for:
- **Low Capital Req.** (Bootstrapped compatibility)
- **High AI Leverage** (Autonomous execution)
- **Direct Substitution** (Replacing an existing invoice)

### Phase C: The Strategic Scorecard (1-5 Scale)
1. Tech Feasibility: 5 = Off-the-shelf APIs; 1 = Proprietary R&D.
2. Perceived Value (USD): 5 = Direct Cash Recovery; 1 = "Nice-to-have".
3. Blue Ocean: 5 = No competition; 1 = Crowded legacy market.
4. Conversion Physics: 5 = Direct Substitution; 1 = Behavioral Redirection.
5. Sales Velocity: 5 = Single decision maker; 1 = Committee approval.

## Sprint 1: The Core (BMC: Value Prop & Customer Segments)
"Initialize Sprint 1. Based on my Business Idea and DNA Configuration:
1. Generate a detailed **Value Proposition** and **USP**.
2. Identify 3-4 **Customer Segments**. For each, define the 'Job-to-be-Done,' the expected benefit, and the pain it solves. 
3. Perform a **Substitution Audit**: Categorize the entry path as 'Direct Substitution' or 'Behavioral Redirection.' 
4. Select the most appropriate **Market Entry Strategy** from the Strategic Library and justify it.
5. **Red-Team Audit:** Identify the 3 biggest 'Happy Assumptions' in this phase."

## Sprint 2: The Logic (BMC: Channels, Relationships & Revenue)
"Initialize Sprint 2. Based on our agreed Value Prop and Segments:
1. Map the **Distribution Channels**. Identify the 'Gatekeepers' (IT, Procurement, Regulators) who can block the sale.
2. Define the **Customer Relationship** strategy (Get, Keep, Grow).
3. Define the **Revenue Streams** and Pricing Logic. 
4. Perform a **Friction Audit**: Estimate the sales cycle length based on the 'Conversion Path' from Sprint 1.
5. **Red-Team Audit:** Challenge the pricing. If a competitor undercuts us by 20%, does the model break?"

---

## Sprint 3: The Machine (BMC: Activities, Resources & Partners)
"Initialize Sprint 3. We must now engineer the 'Product/Service Delivery System'.
1. Define the **MVP Critical Path**: 
    - **Technical Requirements:** Hard specs (Equipment, Software Stack, Tooling).
    - **Asset Genesis Strategy:** How do we build/acquire the core IP/Know-How? (e.g., 'Scrape data from X', 'Hire Specialist Y to code rules', 'License Patent Z'). Don't just list the asset; define the *creation process*.
2. Identify **Key Partners & Suppliers**: Who provides the raw materials or infrastructure we shouldn't build ourselves?
3. Select an **Operational Governance** model from the Strategic Library.
4. Map the **Fulfillment Chain**: Step-by-step, how does the product move from 'Raw Input' to 'Customer Success'?
5. **Red-Team Audit:** Identify the **'Single Point of Failure'**. Is there a specific machine, API, or partner whose failure kills the business immediately?"

---

## Sprint 4: The Physics (BMC: Cost Structure & The Golden Number)
"Initialize Sprint 4. Let's look at the financial reality:
1. Build a **Cost Waterfall**: From raw acquisition to final delivery.
2. Identify the **Golden Number**: The one metric that governs survival.
3. Perform a **Valley of Death Stress-Test**: Model the cashflow for the first 18 months. Consider pipeline filling, GTM, delivery, and payment delays.
4. Search for **Invisible Economics**: (FX, Tax incentives like CBMA, or Salvage opportunities).
5. **Red-Team Audit:** What happens if sales are 20% lower than projected?"

## Sprint 5: Synthesis & Dossier
"The architecture is complete. Synthesize the history of our turns into:
1. A **Master Technical Business Plan** (The internal 'How-to' manual).
2. A **Strategic Dossier Brief** (The 'Portrait' standard). 

**Dossier Requirements:**
The Dossier must follow this specific 20-slide structure, prioritizing 'Industrial Physics' and metric-heavy logic:

- **Slides 1-2: Executive Briefing.** Bold title, 'Tesis Central', and 'Vision & Intention' (The 'Deloitte Quality at Software Price' hook).
- **Slides 3-4: The Problem & The Friction.** Quantify the 'Invisible Tax' (e.g., Logistical lag, Human Error Rate, or Regulatory Discrepancy).
- **Slides 5-6: The Technical USP.** 'The Engine'. Use comparison tables for Specification Parity (CoA matching, % Density, or HS-Code Logic).
- **Slides 7-10: Market Intelligence.** Segment success metrics, Geographic prioritization, and the 'Competitor Matrix' (Brutalista: Manual vs. Legacy vs. Us).
- **Slides 11-13: The Machine (Technical & Operational Architecture).** 
    - *Mandatory:* **MVP Critical Path** (Software/Hardware Specs), **Asset Genesis** (The R&D Plan to build/acquire the Core IP), **CAPEX & Setup Costs** (Initial Investment), and **Shadow Governance** (Human QA/Training).
- **Slides 14-16: Commercial Logic.** Detailed Unit Economics (Gross Profit vs. Adjusted Profit) and 'Allocation Meritocracy' (Priority by Profit Velocity).
- **Slides 17-18: Execution Strategy.** The '180-Day Activation Bridge' and the 'Trojan Horse' entry path.
- **Slide 19: The Endgame.** Exit Liquidity triggers and valuation multiples (6x-12x EBITDA).
- **Slide 20: Conclusion & Mandate.** The 'Strategic Mandate' summary (Asset Lock, Annual GP, and Next Step)."
