# DNA Configuration & Market Entry Library

## 1. The Configuration Layer (The Intake)
Before building the BMC, the Architect must lock in these parameters:
*   **Risk Capital:** (Bootstrapped/Negative Working Capital vs. Heavy CAPEX/Investor Backed).
*   **Asset Posture:** (Asset-Light/Maquila vs. Owned Infrastructure/Moat).
*   **Labor Intensity:** (HR-Heavy/Service vs. Autonomous/Tech-Stack).
*   **Target Persona:** (B2B Industrial vs. B2C Brand vs. B2G Regulatory).

## 2. The Conversion Audit (Mandatory)
Every plan must be categorized into one of two paths:
*   **Path A: Direct Substitution (The Easy Sell):** Replacing an existing line item in the client’s budget. (e.g., Replacing expensive US Malt with cheap B-Grade domestic Malt).
*   **Path B: Behavioral Redirection (The Hard Sell):** Requiring the customer to change their workflow or "evangelize" a new category. (e.g., Convincing a Maquila to use an AI auditor for the first time).

## 3. Market Penetration Catalog
The Architect must select and propose the best strategy from this list:
*   **The Goliath Defense:** Targeting <10% of a segment to avoid price retaliation.
*   **The Trojan Horse:** Entering via a low-cost "Audit" or "Pilot" to prove a gap, then upselling.
*   **The Technical Enclave:** Penetrating through R&D specs so the client cannot switch vendors without a 6-month re-validation.
*   **The Regulatory Squeeze:** Exploiting a specific law or permit that incumbents cannot access.
